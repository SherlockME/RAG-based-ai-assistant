Else we will print. You are offline. Is online is set to true. We will print. You are online. Else if it were false, we print your offline. Art everybody. So those are variables. A variable is a reusable container for a value. There's four basic data types for beginners. A string, which is a series of text. Integers, which are whole numbers, floats, which are numbers, but they contain a decimal portion. And Booleans, which are either true or false, their binary. Your assignment in the comment section is to post four variables, post a string, an integer, a float, and a Boolean. Try and think of a unique example if you can. And while everybody, those are variables in Python. Art everybody. So we are moving on to typecasting. Typecasting is the process of converting a variable from one data type to another. We have various functions to convert a value or variable to a string, an integer, a float, or a Boolean. Let's create some variables. We will create a name variable, type in your full name, an age, make up some age. A GPA for grade point average, let's say minus 3.2. And a Boolean of his student. Are we currently a student? Let's say that's true. Now you actually could get the data type of a variable or a value by using the type function. Then pass in a value or variable. However, when I run this, there's no output. So I need a print statement. We will print what is returned by the type function, get the type of our name variable, then print it. So our name variable is a string, STR. Our age variable is an integer and int. GPA is a float. Is student is a Boolean. Using these type cast functions, we can convert from one data type to another. Here's how. Let's start with something simple. Let's convert our GPA to an integer. Currently, it's a float. I will reassign GPA, use the int function to type cast to an integer, then pass in my GPA. At the end, we will print our GPA. If we type cast 3.2 to a whole integer, what would the result be? A whole integer of three. We truncate the decimal portion. Let's convert our age to a floating point number. We will reassign our variable of age, use the type cast function of float, then insert our age variable. Let's print our age variable. And it should be a floating point number 25.0. Now we'll cover strings. Let's type cast our age to be a string. Age equals call the type cast function of string, STR, pass in our age variable. So the result is still going to appear the same. 25. However, it's a string, not an integer. And to prove that, I will enclose my age variable with the type function. The type of variable age is a string. It would be the same as if we're taking this number and enclosing it within quotes. So this would make a difference because let's say that I add one to age, age plus equals one. Well, we would get a type error. Can only concatenate strings, not integers, to a string. However, if I were to add a string of one to the end, we would be using string concatenation. So let's say it's my birthday and I add one to 25. Well, since we're working with strings now, the result would be 251. I am 251 years old. So strings and numbers behave differently. With numbers, we can use them within arithmetic expressions. Strings, not so much. We will take our name variable and typecast it to a Boolean. Name equals call the type cast function of Boole, pass in our name variable. This has an interesting result. So I'm going to print name. Booleans are either true or false. If I typecast my string of text into a Boolean, that gives me true. Now, it really doesn't matter what I write here. If I were to change my name to a single character such as B, this would still be true. If our string variable was empty, there were no characters within it, that would actually give us false. We could use this to check to see if somebody enters in their name or not. If somebody types in their name, then we typecast it to a Boolean. If somebody skips entering in their name, that would return false. We could reprompt the user to enter in their name again. Art of everybody. So that is typecasting. It is the process of converting a variable from one data type to another. This is especially useful with handling user input. Because user input is always a string. There may be at times where we want to convert it to an integer, a float or a Boolean. And well, everybody, that is typecasting in Python. All right, everybody, in this topic, I'm going to show you how we can accept user input in Python. We use the input function. It's a function that prompts the user to enter in data. And it returns the enter data as a string. Here's an example. To accept user input, we will call the input function. When I run this program, we need to enter in data to our console window. Like so, then hit enter. However, we need a prompt. We need to tell the user what we want them to type in. So let's ask a question. Our prompt will be within quotes. Let's say, what is your name? Let's try this again. What is your name? I can type in something. Why don't you go ahead and type in your full name? Then hit enter. Now with this input, we're not quite doing anything with it. The input function is going to return some data as a string. We can assign it to a variable if we would like. Let's create a variable of name. Name equals our user input. Then once we have our name, let's print a message. I'll use enough string. We will print hello, add a placeholder, then insert our name variable within that placeholder. Let's try this. What is your name? Type in your name. Hit enter. Hello, whatever your name is. Let's try a different name. I will pick SpongeBob. Many people are familiar with SpongeBob. Hello, SpongeBob. This time we will ask a user how old they are. Let's assign a variable of age equals except some user input. We need a prompt within quotes. How old are you? Once we have our age variable, let's print. I'll use an F string. You are at a placeholder, our variable age. Years old. What is your name? Type in your name. How old are you? Let's say that I'm 25. Hello, whatever your name is. You are whatever your age is. Years old. Alright, so let's say that it's our birthday. Before we print our age variable, let's say happy birthday. Since I'm not inserting any variables within this print statement, this doesn't need to be an F string. You'll want to use an F string if you want to insert variables. Before we display the user's age, let's take the user's age and increase it by one. We could say age equals age plus one. But there's one problem with this. Type in a name. How old are you? Type in an age. And we have a problem. We have a type error. It can only concatenate strings, not integers to strings. When we accept user input, we store that input as a string. Before we increment our age by one, we'll need to convert it to an integer. We can't normally use strings within arithmetic expressions. But we can do that with integers and floats though. After we accept some user input for our age variable, we'll take our age variable and type cast it as an integer, which we talked about in the previous lesson. So let's say age equals our age after we type cast it, then increment it by one. So type in your name. Type in an age. And we get this message. Hello, your name. Happy birthday. You are whatever your age is. You're old. So strings, we can't normally use with arithmetic expressions. We would have to type cast it to an integer or a float. However, we could condense some of these steps. We're taking up an extra line to type cast our age as an integer. What we could do instead is that when we accept our user input, we can enclose the input function within a type cast to int. And that would work the same. Type in your name. Type in an age. And this works the same. And it takes less lines of code. And is more readable, I would say. When we accept user input, it returns that input as a string data type. Then we just have to type cast it to another data type if we need to. And in this case for age, we do. Now we'll go over a couple exercises. Because it's important to practice what you've learned. In this first exercise, we're going to calculate the area of a rectangle. We need to prompt the user to enter in a length and the width of a rectangle. So we will create a variable of length. We will accept some user input using the input function. What is our prompt? Let's say enter the length. Let's do this with width. I'll just copy and paste what we have. Width equals enter the width. So we have the length and the width. To get the area of a rectangle, we have to multiply the length by the width. So let's say area equals our length variable. Now to use multiplication, you use an asterisk. We'll discuss different arithmetic operators in the next lesson. So we have length times width. That is the area. I'm going to print our area. Because I need to test something. Enter the length, let's say, 5 inches, 5 centimeters, doesn't matter. Enter the width, 6. We get a type error. Can't multiply sequence by non-int, non-integer of type string. When we accept user input, it returns a value of the string data type. We can't use those strings in arithmetic expressions. We're multiplying the length times the width. We would need to typecast them as an integer or a float. Since we're working with basic geometry, such as calculating the area, let's do float. So let's typecast our user input as a float for both length and width. Okay, let's try this again. Let's say 5 times 6. The area that's returned to us is 30, 30.0. This result contains a decimal. It's a floating point number, a float. So when we print the area, I'll use an F string this time. The area is, I'll add a placeholder, display our area variable. Let's add a unit of measurement afterwards. I'll pick centimeters. Now since we're working with areas, if we would like to technically be accurate. So we could say to the power of 2, or we could add a superscript. So if you would like superscript 2 and you're on windows, make sure numlock is on, hold alt, then type on the numpad 0178. So we have a superscript of 2. Again, it's not really necessary for this lesson. I just think it'd be cool to include it, because then it's technically accurate. Alright, let's say that the length is 6.1, and the width is 7.2. The area is 43.92, centimeter squared, because we're working with areas. Let's cover a second exercise. This time we will create a shopping cart program. Exercise 2, we're going to create a shopping cart program. We need three variables, an item, a price, and a quantity of those items. We will create a variable of item. We will accept some user input. What item would you like to buy? What are we trying to purchase? We'll keep the data type of the user input as a string. Then we need a price. What is the price of each item we're buying? Use the input function. What is the price? A price should be a floating point number. For example, we might have dollars and cents. We need a decimal."}
