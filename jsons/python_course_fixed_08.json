If our user input principle is less than or equal to 0, we need to inform the user. Principle can't be less than or equal to 0. So I'm going to test my program by printing the principle at the end just temporarily. Enter the principle amount. I can't type a negative number and continue. What if my investment was negative $1,000? Principle can't be less than or equal to 0. How about 0? Nope, can't do that either. Is a thousand, okay? Yep, a thousand works. That is for the principle. Let's copy this wildoop, paste it, replace principle with rate. This is the rate of interest. Enter the interest rate. Interest rate can't be less than or equal to 0. Then let's copy this again, paste it, change rate to time. Let's type cast our input as an integer because we're working with whole years. Enter the time in years. Time can't be less than or equal to 0. I'm going to print my principle rate and time. We have principle rate time. Okay, we know that principle works. Enter the interest rate. Can my interest rate be negative 1? No, it can't. Can it be 0? Nope. How about 10? 10%. All right, that works. Time can time be 0. No, it can't. Can my time be negative 1? No, it can't. What about three years? All right, so we know that our wildoops are working. Now here's the formula to calculate interest. Let's say our total, that's our total balance, equals our principle times 1 plus our value. Divided by 100. I'm going to enclose this function with the set of parentheses. This portion of our function will take our interest rate, which is a whole number, then create a decimal, enclose this function within the power function. Raise this function to the power of time. And that is how to calculate compound interest. Then we will print the new balance. I'll use an F string. Balance after our variable time, the word years. I'll add a placeholder. We will add our total. Then I'll include a dollar sign. Maybe this will be in dollars, but pick any unit of currency you would like. I will format this variable with the format's specifier. We will display two decimal places. Point to F. Okay, let's try this. Enter the principal amount I invest $1,000 into maybe the stock market. The interest rate is maybe 10% this year. The time in years will be 1%. So after 1 year at 10% interest, my new balance is $1,100. Let's try it one more time for good measure. Maybe $500 with an interest rate of 7. Over 2 years, your new balance would be $572.45. All right, now there is another way of writing this program. What if we would like to allow the user to enter in values that are equal to 0? While principal is less than 0, if principal is less than 0, principal can't be less than 0. Let's do that for rate. Interest can't be less than 0. Time can't be less than 0. Here's what happens to our program. Remember that we're declaring our variables at the top? Nothing happens. We go straight to the results. So the reason that this is happening is that when we reach the while loops, this condition is false from the beginning. We never end up entering these while loops. We skip over them because these three conditions are all false. We can write a different variation of this while loop, where we could say, while true. True is a Boolean. That means this while loop will continue forever, unless we explicitly break out of the while loop. We're going to add an else clause. Else, we will break. Break will break out of a loop. With our second while loop, change rate is less than 0 to while true. Then we will add an else clause. Else, break out of the loop. While true. Else, break out of the loop. We should be able to enter 0 values in now. Enter the principal amount, 0, 0, 0. Balance after 0 years is 0 dollars. This should work the same as before, but we should be allowed to enter in 0 values. $1000. Interest rate of 0. After 1 year is still $1000. Well, okay, then everybody, I thought that would be an interesting project to create. Now that we know how while loops work, you could write either a standard while loop with a condition such as principal is less than or equal to 0. Or you could say while true. This loop would continue forever. You would need to explicitly break out of the while loop using this break keyword, which will cover again in four loops. But yeah, that is a compound interest calculator in Python. Hey everybody in this topic, I need to explain four loops. A four loop will execute a block of code a fixed number of times. You can iterate over a range, a string, a sequence, anything that is considered iterable. I'll have more examples for you in future topics. There is a lot of overlap where you could use either a while loop or a four loop. But four loops tend to be better in situations where you have to do something only a fixed number of times. Here's an example. Suppose we need to count to 10. If we were to use a four loop, we could write something like this. We would type 4. Then we would need some sort of counter. Typically you see people write X. 4, X, in. Then we will use the range function. What number would we like to start at? I would like to start at 1, then count to 10. But the second number is exclusive, so really we're going to write 11 if we want to count to 10. So then colon, then hit enter. Whatever code you would like to repeat a certain number of times, you will list underneath the four loop and make sure the code is indented to you. I will print whatever our counter X is. When I run this code, we will begin at 1, then stop once we reach 11. So yeah, there we are. We have begun at 1, and we have counted all the way to 10. So that's the basic syntax for a four loop. For some counter, really you can name this anything. Sometimes you'll see people name this as counter. And that would work too. But let's stick with X. In. Some range. Where would we like to begin? Where do we stop? Okay, now let's count backwards. Let's start at 10, then count down to zero. When we escape the four loop, let's print happy new year. When we print happy new year, we are outside of the four loop. Two count backwards, you can enclose your range function within the reversed function reversed. So we begin at 10, count down to 1, then print happy new year in this case. Two count backwards, you would enclose the range function within the reversed function. There is an additional parameter to you could add. That is the step. If you would like to count by 2, you would add comma 2. So I'm going to get rid of happy new year. Let's print the numbers 1 through 10, but we will count by 2's. And this does begin at 1 though. So 1, 3, 5, 7, 9. If you were to change the step to 3, you would count by 3's. Beginning at 1, 4, 7, 10. So the range function isn't the only thing you can iterate over. You can iterate over a string. Let's say we have a credit card number. Credit card equals, I'll make up some credit card number with dashes. That is good enough. 4x in credit card, print x. X will hold our current position. At first it will be 1, then 2, 3, 4, dash, so on and so forth. So here's our credit card number. 1, 2, 3, 4, dash, 5, 6, 7, 8. I think you get the idea. So you can iterate over a string with the for loop as well. We'll have a few projects involving that. There are two useful keywords as well. These aren't exclusive to for loops. You can use these within while loops as well. They are continue and break. Suppose we are going to count to 20. 4x in range. We will begin at 1. Stop at 21. I think this is kind of a dumb example, but it gets the point across. 13 is considered an unlucky number right. What if our count to reach is 13? I would like to skip over it. Well, we can do that with the continue keyword. If x is equal to 13, we will continue. And skip over that iteration. Else, we will print whatever our count is. So let's take a look. Yeah, we have the numbers 1 through 20, but we have skipped the number 13. To skip over an iteration, you can use the continue keyword. Whereas the break keyword, we will break out of this loop entirely. If x is equal to 13, then break. So yeah, we have only counted to 12. Once we reach 13, we have escaped the loop. So yeah, everybody, those are for loops. You can execute a block of code a fixed number of times. You can iterate over a range, a string, a sequence, anything that is considered iterable. There is a lot of overlap where you could use either a while loop or a for loop. While loops tend to be better if you need to execute something, possibly infinite amount of times. Such as when you're accepting user input, for example. But yeah, everybody, those are for loops in Python. What is going on, everybody? In today's topic, we're going to be creating a countdown timer in Python. We'll be using what we learned in the previous topics. Let's begin. We'll need to import the time module. There's a pretty cool function within the time module. That is the sleep function. Type time.sleep.adiseta.princesses. Within the set of parentheses, our program will essentially sleep for a given amount of seconds, like three. After three seconds, let's print something. This is just a demonstration. Times up. When I execute this code, nothing happens for three seconds. But after three seconds passes, it displays our message. Times up. So you can use the sleep function of the time module to sleep for a given amount of time. We will ask the user, how long would they like to set the time before? We will create a variable. Let's say my time. My time will be in seconds. We will create a prompt. Enter the time in seconds. Then we should type cast, our input, as an integer. We'll need to create a loop. We could use either a while loop or a for loop. There's a lot of overlap where you could use either one. I'll use a for loop in this case. For, we'll need some sort of counter. X, in, our range. Zero through my time. After each iteration, we will sleep for one second. Let's test what we have so far. I would like to sleep for three seconds. I think that's approximately three. But now we are going to print whatever x's. Print x. X is our counter. Zero, one, two, times up. We're getting somewhere. But I would like to count backwards. What we could do is enclose our range function within the reversed function. But another technique that we can use is by using a step. Let's replace zero with my time. Then end, add zero. But we will set the step to be negative one. Then we can increment backwards using this function. That's another technique too to count backwards. So let's wait for three seconds. Three, two, one, times up. Now let's display a digital clock of some sort. But we would have to calculate how many hours, minutes, and seconds there are. So let's calculate seconds. Seconds equals x. X is our counter, remember. Modulus 60. Within our print statement, we'll use an f-string. We are displaying hours, minutes, and seconds. I'll add some placeholders for each of these fields. We have seconds with our digital clock. We can't go above 60 for either seconds or minutes. That's why I'm using modulus 60. The modulus operator gives you the remainder of any division. Let's begin at 11. So 11, 10."}
