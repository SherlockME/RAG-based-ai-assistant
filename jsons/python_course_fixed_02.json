Then a quantity. We will accept some user input. Our prompt will be How many would you like? Quantities, they should be whole numbers. Let's type cast our input as an integer. Then we will have a total. What's the total that we have to pay? So let's take the price of each item. Use an asterisk for multiply our quantity. Then let's do a test run. Let's print our total. What item would you like to buy? Let's say a pizza. What is the price? 1099. How many would you like? I would like five pizzas. And our total is 54.95. Let's say that before we display the total. Let's print the following. I'll use an F string. You have bought insert a placeholder. Display our quantity. X item or items. I'll add slash us. Then we will print. I'll use an F string again. Your total is display our total. What item would you like to buy? I would like to buy a pizza. What is the price? 1099. How many would you like? I would like nine pizzas. They're all for me. I'm going to eat all of them. You have bought nine X pizzas. Your total is 98.91. Let's add a unit of currency before this. Pick unit of currency before displaying the total.

Your total is 119. And 88 cents. Art everybody. That is how to accept user input in Python. And we've covered a few exercises in the next topic. We're going to create a madlibs game. And that is how to accept user input in Python. All right, everybody. In this video, we're going to create a game of madlibs. Not because we have to, but because I want to. It would be a good exercise for us. Just so we're more comfortable with accepting user input. If you're not familiar with madlibs, madlibs is a word game where you create a story by filling in the blanks with random words. So we're going to create a story template. The story is going to be missing some components. We will fill in those components with random words that we type in. Here's a story that I've written myself. Print. Use an F string. Today, I went to a insert a placeholder. Zoo. For our placeholder, we'll insert an adjective. We'll insert a variable named adjective. Adjective. Adjective one. You're going to get an English lesson today too. And adjective is a description of something. So for our zoo, adjective one could be expensive, large, dirty, and adjective describe something. We'll fill this in when we accept user input. For our second print statement, let's print the following in an exhibit. I saw a placeholder. We'll include a noun. Noun one. A noun is a person, place, or thing in English. Maybe a gorilla, a gorilla named Rambe, for example. Print. Use an F string. Let's say our noun one, whatever this is, we can reuse variables. Was. We will create a second adjective. Adjective two. We will be describing whatever noun one is. This person, place, or thing. And we will insert a verb, verb one. A verb is an action, such as running or eating. Then for our last statement, let's print. I was at a placeholder. We'll create adjective three. Adjective three will describe us. Now we're going to fill in these variables by accepting user input. We're going to fill in adjective one. We'll accept user input using the input function. Enter and adjective. I'm going to add a reminder that an adjective is a description of something. Then we need noun one. Noun one equals input. Enter a noun. A noun is a person, place, or thing. Then we have adjective two. I'll just copy adjective one, paste it, change one to two. Then a verb, verb one equals input. Enter a verb. I want verb one to be in current tense. I'll ask the user to end the verb with I and G. Enter a verb ending with I and G. Then it's current tense. Our person, place, or thing of noun one is currently doing something, such as eating. And then adjective three. And I'll just copy one of these adjectives. Adjective three equals input. Enter an adjective. Okay. And then we are ready to run this. Enter an adjective. An adjective describes something. I will say suspicious. Or some kids like to say, Sussi or Suss even. I've also heard of kids nowadays using the word skimpy. Feel free to type in whatever you would like. It is your story after all. I'm going to say suspicious. Enter a noun, a person, place, or thing. I like to poke fun at Mark Zuckerberg. So I'm going to say my person is Mark Zuckerberg. Enter an adjective. That is a description. Angry. Enter a verb ending with I and G. So it's current tense. Screaching. Enter an adjective. Happy. Here's my story. Today I went to a suspicious zoo in an exhibit. I saw a Mark Zuckerberg. Mark Zuckerberg was angry and screeching. I was happy. That's our game of madlibs. It's a word game where you create a story by filling in the blanks with random words. Also, post the output of your madlibs game in the comment section down below because I really want to read them. I want to see what you guys came up with. And while everybody that is a madlibs game using Python. Hey everybody. In this video, I'm going to show you all of the different math that will need throughout the rest of the series. I have a lot to cover and I'll split this video into different sections. We'll cover some basic arithmetic operators, built-in math functions, a few functions from the math module, and then a few exercises. Be sure to look at the timestamps if you would like to skip ahead to another section. Let's begin with some really easy stuff. We're going to cover some basic arithmetic operators. Let's say we have a variable, friends. Currently you have zero friends. If you need to increment a variable by one, you could say, friends, the name of the variable equals the name of the variable again, plus one. So the plus sign is the addition operator. And I think we do have a little bit of experience with that already. So if I were to print my variable friends, guess what? You now have one friend. We could also shorten this line of code. You could say friends plus equals one. That would do the same thing. This is known as an augmented assignment operator. Now we'll give you the same result. I prefer to use augmented assignment operators just because they take less text. And I think they're easier to read. Now let's use subtraction. Friends equals friends minus two. So of course, minus is the subtraction operator. You have negative two friends, I guess. If you were to use the augmented assignment operator, that would be friends minus equals two. There you still have negative two friends. Okay, multiplication. Let's change friends to how about five friends equals friends times three. You now have 15 friends. Then the augmented assignment operator version of this would be friends times equals three. So again, you have 15 friends. Let's cover division. Friends equals friends divided by two. So we have 2.5 friends. Somebody was cut in half. We have half a friend. Maybe it's just their legs or torso or something. Then the augmented assignment operator would be friends divided by equals two. And the result is still the same. Now exponents. Friends equals friends to the power of two. So friends is currently five. Friends to the power of two would be five times five, which is 25. The augmented assignment operator version of this equation would be friends exponent equals two. And again, friends is 25. Then we have modulus. Modulus gives you the remainder of any division. Suppose we have 10 friends instead of five. I will assign a new variable remainder. Remander equals friends. The percent sign is known as the modulus operator. It will give us the remainder of any division. If I were to divide my group of friends by three, we will have one remaining. I'll store the remainder within a separate variable. We would have a remainder of one. It's kind of like in class, when the teacher says for everybody in the class to go into groups of three, then there's always that one kid that's by themselves. That's kind of the same concept. We're dividing our friends into groups of three. Then the modulus will give you the remainder. If we divided our group of friends into groups of two, well, 10 divides by two evenly. So there is no remainder. So that is the modulus operator. It's fairly popular to use this operator to find if a number is even or odd because it will divide by two evenly if that number is even. If the remainder is one, that means that the original number is odd. Okay, so yeah, those are some basic arithmetic operators. Additions, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, then modulus. Now what we're going to do is cover some built-in math-related functions. Suppose we have three variables. X equals 3.14. Y equals 4. Z equals 5. It doesn't matter if these are floating point numbers or whole integers. The first is the round function. We have a variable named result. I'm going to round X. So there is a built-in round function after the set of parentheses. We can add some value or variable to be rounded. So we will round X to the nearest whole integer. Then print the result. So our result is 3. So that's the round function. With the absolute value function, we can find the absolute value of a number. Let's change Y to be negative 4 instead of 4. We'll take result equals a, b, s, which means absolute value of Y. The absolute value is the distance away from 0 as a whole number. The absolute value of negative 4 is 4. Let's change Y back to 4. There's a built-in power function. Results equals power. Then we'll need a base and an exponent. What's Y to the power of 3? That would be 4 times 4 times 4. Which is 64. That's the power function. You can raise the base to a given power. The next two are really useful. Using the max function, we can find the maximum value of various values. What's the maximum value between X, Y and Z? Then I'll just need to store this value. Results equals the max between X, Y and Z. The maximum value is 5. Otherwise, there's min. What's the minimum value between X, Y and Z? That would be 3.14. In this next section, we do have some very useful constants and functions from the math class. But we'll need to import the math module at the top of our text editor. So import math. If you need the value of pi, you'll type the name of the math module, dot pi. And I'm just going to print this."}
