So it is counting down, but I would like to add some zero padding and we can do that with the format specifier After seconds I will add colon. I need to display two digits Then zero pad those digits. Let's try that again. I will wait for 11 seconds 11 10 9. Yeah, and we do have some zero padding So that's looking more and more like a digital clock. Let's add minutes then So to calculate minutes, let's assign variable minutes equal to X divided by 60 because there's 60 seconds within a minute, but then I'm going to type cast the result as an integer Modulus 60 we would not like this field of minutes to go above 60 So let's add a placeholder or displaying minutes format specifier 0, 2 Now I'm going to wait for 65 seconds that is one minute and five seconds Then I just want to be sure that we go below a minute Yep, it's working Then let's calculate hours. Oh, by the way to stop your program from running hit this red square up in the corner Let's calculate hours hours equals X divided by 1600 there's 3600 seconds in an hour Then we will type cast the result as an integer Within our F string we will display hours format specifier 0 to Then I will run this program. Let's wait for 3600 five seconds. That is one hour and five seconds And I just want to be sure that we go below one hour Yeah, all right, so that works So the reason that I didn't add Modulus 24 I don't have days within my F string We can display any amount of hours. I will exclude Modulus 24 All right, everybody well. I thought that'd be some good practice with working with loops We should try and do as many exercises as we can and yeah That is a countdown timer program in Python Hey, everybody, so I guess in today's topic I'm gonna be explaining nested loops it looks like so a nested loop Think of it as a loop found within the code of another loop You have a loop right any code within that loop is indented underneath that loop Well, you could have a looping structure found within the code of another looping structure The loop on the outside is the outer loop the internal loop within the outer loop is known as the inner loop Where you'll encounter nested loops it's really situational You can have a while loop inside of a while loop before loop inside of a for loop A for loop inside of a while loop a while loop inside of a for loop, etc So here's a demonstration Let's begin by displaying the numbers one through nine, but we'll use a loop four x x's are counter in range 1 comma 10 remember that the second number in this case 10 that's exclusive Then I will print our counter x This program will print the numbers one through nine Now we have an exercise at the end of this topic. I should probably explain this feature So with a print statement we end each print statement with a new line character If I need all of these numbers on the same line at the end of my print statement I can add comma and Equals an empty string Normally with a print statement each ends with a new line character, but we can set that to be something else So when I run this again all of these numbers are on the same line or you could add a different symbol like dash or a space Each of these characters is now separated with the space But let's stick with an empty string Okay, so we have used a loop to count the numbers one through nine What if I would like to repeat this three times? Well, I could create another loop four x in range You could say one comma four or you could just say three either way Whatever code is within this loop will be executed three times Let's cut our original for loop Then place it within the code of our new loop Our outer loop will have this code repeat entirely three separate times But we do have one thing we need to pay attention to We have two counters with the same name. You'll want to be sure that they're different Let's rename the counter of the inner loop to be y instead of x and be sure to change that here as well Now Now when I run this code we're completing let's see 27 iterations to exit this for loop We need to count the numbers one through nine Once we do so that is one iteration of the outer loop But our outer loop is saying hey, we still need three total iterations Now if you would like these on separate lines Let's make this look a little different. Let's add each iteration of the outer loop onto a new line So within the outer loop, but not within the inner loop I'm going to create just a blank print statement. This will just print a new line. Let's try this again With the inner loop we count the numbers one through nine after we exit the four loop we will print a new line Then repeat this all over again until our outer loop is satisfied So that's basically a nested loop. It's just a loop that's inside of another looping structure So let's create a project. We're going to print a rectangle made of some symbol that we set We'll have the user type in how many rows and columns this rectangle will have we'll reuse this code that we have already written So this time let's accept some user input rows equals input Enter the number of rows then we should type cast this input as an integer Let's copy this line paste it Change rows to columns for the second line enter the number of columns Then let's create a symbol symbol equals input Enter a symbol to use We already have this rectangle structure right think of it as the outer loop is in charge of the rows Let's change in range three to in range rows The inner loop will be in charge of the columns for why in range columns We will print our symbol whatever the user chooses So let's try this again enter the number of rows how about four rows 10 columns I'll use a dollar sign So here's our rectangle We have four rows Then 10 columns one two three four five six seven eight nine ten. Let's try one more time Three rows Five columns and I'll use an asterisk Yep, three rows Five columns So yeah, that's an nested loop really it's just a loop that's inside of another loop The type of loop really doesn't matter as well as what's within each loop It's just a situation where you have a loop inside of another loop and yeah, those are nested loops in python Well, hello everybody today. I will be explaining a few different types of collections in python There's four general purpose collections three of them are lists sets and tuples There are also dictionaries, but I'll save that for the next topic because they can be kind of tricky A collection I would think of them as a single variable and I'm saying that within quotes that is used to store Multiple values. That's how I would explain a collection to a beginner For example, let's say we have a variable variable Fruit fruit equals some value like apple and then I can print this fruit Which is apple I could turn this variable into a collection By surrounding my values with either a set of square brackets for a list curly braces for a set or parentheses for a tuple Let's begin with the list If I would like to store more than one value in this variable, I will surround my values with the set of square brackets This variable is now a list. I can store multiple values separated with a comma Not only do we have an apple in this variable, but we have an orange A banana And coconut One naming convention that I like to use if I declare a collection such as a list set or tuple I like to take the variable name and make it plural just so that it's more obvious that this is a collection of values Technically in the English language fruit would still be plural English is a weird language We now have a list of fruit named fruits If I were to print my list This is the result We have all of our values enclosed with a set of square brackets To access one of these elements found within your list You can use the index operator much like what we can do with strings The first element would have an index of zero That would print my value apple Index of one would be my orange Two is banana Three Coconut What about four? We don't have a value there List index out of range Each value in a collection is also known as an element If we attempt to access an element that's not found within our collection You'll run into an index error With the index operator You could set a beginning index An ending index and a step I would like the first three elements You could say zero Cole in Three That would give me apple orange banana Technically you don't even need the zero You'd need that colon though We can even use a step I would like every second element Apple banana It's every second element beginning from index zero Maybe I would like my fruit backwards I'll set the step to be negative one Coconut banana orange apple You can use the index operator With collections much like you can use with strings Another cool thing you can do too with collections Is that you can iterate over them with the for loop For x in my collection fruits What would we like to do? I will print whatever x is So we have iterated over our list Apple orange banana coconut Now x isn't really too descriptive What you'll see some people do Is that with their collection name it's plural Their counter will be the singular version of that word If our collection name is fruits Let's rename x as fruit singular It's not mandatory but that's a common convention It's more readable that way For every fruit in fruits If this were cars you could say for car in cars Our counter is storing whatever value is within our collection So what are all the different methods that we can use with collections To list the different methods that are available to a collection You can use the Dure function Within this function add your collection fruits But we wouldn't need to print this Let's surround this function with a print statement These are all in alphabetical order We have attributes which I have not explained yet But I will in a future topic But if we scroll to the end We have a bunch of different methods that this list can perform A pen, clear, copy, account, extent, index, insert, pop, remove, reverse And sort If you would like a description of each of these methods There is a help function Help add your collection to the parentheses Then we would need to print this Here's the description of all the methods and attributes For example we have our sort method And here's the description Sort the list in ascending order and return none And then a bunch of other stuff If you ever forget what you're capable of with a list or other collection You can always use the help function To print a description of the attributes and methods available If you need the length of how many elements are within a collection There is the length function Return the length of my list fruits Then let's print it There's four elements within my list The length function returns for If I were to add an extra element like a pineapple Then that number would be five Let's remove that Using the in operator we can find if a value is within a collection Is our value apple in fruits But then we would need to print this This operator will return a boolean So let's print whatever that is Is apple in fruits That is true But is pineapple Pineapple is not it's false You can use the in operator to find if a value is within a list And that applies for your other collections too With lists they're ordered and changeable Duplicates are okay We can change one of these values after we create our list Let's take fruits at index of zero I will set this equal to be a pineapple Then let's iterate over our fruit Using a for loop Okay the first element is no longer an apple It's a pineapple Then orange banana coconut Using an index you can reassign one of the values Power to change zero to one Well now we have an apple pineapple banana coconut Let's cover some of the methods that are found within a list We can append an element Type the name of the list Dot Append What would we like to append to the end of this list Let's append a pineapple I'm going to get rid of this for loop I'm just going to display my list There we have it"}
