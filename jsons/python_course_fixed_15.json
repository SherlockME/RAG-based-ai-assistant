Let's see what we have so far. How many dice I would like 5 dice? Our total is 19. Now between these two for loops, we will display our ASCII art. The easiest way would be to create some nested for loops. The outer for loop will be in charge of the number of dice. For every die in our range, number of dice. The inner for loop will be in charge of printing every tuple. For every line in, then to get a value in our dictionary, we would type the name of the dictionary dice art, then use the get method. What are we getting? We're getting a value at a given key. Let's take our list of numbers dice at index of die our counter. Depending on what the user types in for the number of dice, die will begin at one, then increment. Within the inner for loop, we will print the line. Let's take a look. How many dice I would like 3 dice? Here's our ASCII art. 6 plus 2 plus 4. That equals 12. If you would prefer, we can display all of these dice on a single horizontal line instead of one vertical line. It's a little more tricky though. If you would prefer that approach, let's turn this chunk of code into comments. We will write this nested loop a little different. So each tuple is made up of 5 elements, right? So if we're printing a horizontal line, let's say we roll the numbers 1 through 3. We would first need to display this line of the first dice, then the first line of the second dice, then the first line of the third dice. During the next iteration of the outer loop, we would display the second line of the first dice, the second line of the second dice, the second line of the third dice. So it's a little more complex. Let's create an outer loop that will iterate 5 times for every line in range 5. Then the nested loop will be for every die in dice. How many dice do we have within our list? We will print. We're going to get one of the values found at one of the numbers that we roll. Take our dictionary of dice art dot get then a number 1 through 6. That will be the value found within our list of dice. Get the current die. Remember that this is a number 1 through 6. We would then need one of the elements found within our tuple. So get the first line, then the second line, third, fourth, fifth. So let's add the index operator. Place our counter of line within the index operator. Let's see what we have so far. We need to add one more thing. How many dice three? This is an abomination. There's one more change we need to make. At the end of our print statement, let's set the ending character to be an empty string. And that should fix that. How many dice three? Okay, we're getting better results. Then when we escape the interloop, we will print a new line. How many dice three? And there we are. Three plus six plus one is 10. All right, everybody. So that is a dice roller program. It is kind of complex. But I thought this might be a good exercise. If you would like a copy of this code, I will post all of this in the comments section down below. And well, yeah, that's a dice roller program in Python. Hey, everybody. Today I need to explain fun functions. Think of a function as a block of reusable code to invoke a function. You place a set of parentheses after the function name to invoke it. Here's a scenario. I need to sing Happy Birthday three times. I know it's a weird example, but it makes a lot of sense. Just trust me on this. If I need to sing Happy Birthday three times, I would write something like this. I'm going to create my own version of the Happy Birthday song. This is one verse. If I need to repeat this code three times without using functions, I could either repeat this code or maybe place it within a loop. So here's my Happy Birthday song three times. But there's a better way of handling this that doesn't involve repeating our code or using loops. What if I could write this code once, then reuse it whenever I need to? That's where functions come in to define a function. You would type D E F, then a unique function name. Let's name this function the Happy Birthday function at a set of parentheses, a colon, any code that belongs to the function you'll want to indent underneath. Then to invoke this function, I would type the name of the function Happy Birthday at a set of parentheses. And that's it. When you invoke this function, you will execute this code once. If I need to execute this code three times, I would just call it two more times. Happy Birthday, Happy Birthday, Happy Birthday. To invoke a function, you type the function name, then at a set of parentheses. I like to think of the parentheses as a pair of telephones talking to each other. You call a function to invoke it. Hey, Happy Birthday function, execute your code with functions. You are able to send a data directly to a function using one or known as arguments. You can send values or variables directly to a function. Place any data within the set of parentheses. I'll send my function a first name. Any data you send a function are known as arguments, but you need a matching set of parameters that are in order. What exactly is the data we're sending in? Well, it's a name. I will add one parameter to my Happy Birthday function. I will name this data name. A parameter is kind of like a temporary variable that's used within a function. I'm going to replace this instance of you with a name. I will use an F string, replace you with a placeholder. I will add my parameter name. So Happy Birthday to bro, we could pass in some other names. What about Steve? And Joe. Here we are. Happy Birthday to bro. Happy Birthday to Steve. Happy Birthday to Joe. When you invoke a function, you can send more than one argument. Let's send an age this time. I'll send 20, 30, and 40. But when I run this, we have an error. We're passing in two arguments, but our function is set up only to take one. I would need a matching number of arguments to invoke this function. We will need two parameters. We have a name and we have an age. Then let's use this age. You are, let's make this line enough string. Age, years old. Let's try that again. Happy Birthday to bro. You are 20 years old. Happy Birthday to Steve. You are 30 years old. Happy Birthday to Joe. You are 40 years old. When you invoke a function, you can pass in some data. Those are known as arguments. But you'll need a matching set of parameters. The order does matter. Let's see what happens when I switch these two parameters. Age, then name. Happy Birthday to 20. You are bro years old. Happy Birthday to 30. You are Steve years old. Happy Birthday to 40. You are Joe years old. So the position of the parameters does matter. Same thing goes with the arguments. You also could name these parameters something unique. Maybe X and Y. Happy Birthday to X. You are Y years old. That's also valid. Let's try another example. I'm going to create a function to display an invoice. There will be three parameters, a username, an amount, and a due date. Let's print. Hello. I should make this an F string. User name. We'll use another F string. Your bill of amount. Let's precede this place holder with the unit of currency. I will also add a format specifier. Point to F is do on our due date. Whatever that parameter is to invoke this function, we will type the functions name, add a set of parentheses, a username, an amount, and a due date. Let's make up some username and amount. I guess $42.50. I'm just making up a number here. Then a due date. The first of January, I guess. Here's my invoice. Hello, bro code. Your bill of $42.50 is due on January 1st. Let's change these arguments. Joe Shmo is the username. He owes $100 and one penny. Do on the first of February or January 2nd depending on how you read dates in your region. Hello, Joe Shmo. Your bill of $100 and one cent is due on one slash two. That's another example. Now we need to explain the return statement. Return is a statement that is used to end a function and send a result back to the caller. Here's an example. We have a variable Z. Z will equal. We'll invoke a function to add two numbers together, such as the numbers one and two. When we invoke a function, we can send some data back. After adding one and two, we will send the result, which would be three. Then this value can be assigned to a variable. Then we can print whatever Z is. So let's create some functions. Let's create a function to add two numbers together. The parameters will be x and y. Let's say Z equals x plus y. Then we will return our value Z. So I'm not going to print Z directly right now. Let's subtract x and y. Subtract Z equals x minus y. Return Z. Multiply x times y. Then divide. x divided by y returns Z. Let's invoke our add function, pass in two numbers, one and two. Then I'm going to print the result. After adding these two numbers together, the result is three. What about subtract? Subtract one and two. The result is next."}
