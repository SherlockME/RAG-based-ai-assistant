The values are unordered and immutable, meaning we can't alter these values. However, we can add and remove elements. A set does not include any duplicates. I'm going to delete these methods. Then print fruits. We have all of the same values, but they're not in the same order as they were originally. A set is unordered. If I were to run this again, they will likely be in a different order. See now we have a banana apple coconut orange. To display all of the different attributes and methods of a set, you can use the Der function. And here's all of them. Some of these methods are a little more advanced, but there's a few we might recognize, like add, clear, copy. For an in-depth description of these methods, you can use the help function. Much like what we did before. To find the length of our set, we can use the length function, which is four. We can use the in-operator to find if a value is found within the set. Unfortunately, pineapples are not within our set. Now if I was to use the index operator of my set, this is what would happen. We have an error. Set object is not subscriptable. We're not able to use indexing on a set because they're unordered. Much like what we can do with a list or a string. We can't change the values of a set, but we could add a remove elements. Let's use the add method to add, guess what, a pineapple. That is okay. Orange apple pineapple coconut banana. We can remove an element, fruits.remove. Let's remove our apple. Our apple is gone, coconut orange banana. We can pop. The pop method will remove whatever element is first, but it's going to be random though. Orange coconut banana. Apple coconut banana. Apple banana coconut. You can clear, fruits.clear. The elements of our set are gone. Those are a few of the more useful methods for beginners. As a summary, a set is a collection that is unordered and immutable. You can't change the values, but adding and removing elements is okay. No duplicates are allowed. Let's try that real quick. I'm going to add a second coconut. Yeah, see, we only still have one coconut. Sets may work well if you're working with constants. Maybe colors, for example. You need to find if a color is within a set. Alright, now lastly, let's talk about tuples. A tuple is a collection that is surrounded with a set of parentheses. Tuples are ordered and unchangeable. Duplicates are okay. One benefit of a tuple over a list is that tuples are faster than lists. If you're working with a collection, and it's okay if the collection is ordered and unchangeable, you might as well use a tuple because it's faster. When I print our tuple, all of these values are surrounded with a set of parentheses. Again, we have the dur function to display the attributes and methods. There's not as many for a tuple for methods. We only have count and index. Again, there's also help to display a description of these attributes and methods. You can find the length of a tuple with the length function. We have five elements within here. Using the in-op parameter, we can find if a value is found within our tuple. Our pineapple is not within our fruits. So there's only two methods we have access to. Let's find the index of apple. Fruits.index. Apple. Then I will print whatever is returned. Apple is found at index zero. There's also count. Fruits.count. How many coconuts are found within our tuple fruits? Count the coconuts. Then print this. How many coconuts do we have? Two coconuts. And then again, with any of these collections, they're iterable so you can iterate over them using a for loop. Four fruit and fruits. Yep, apple orange banana coconut coconut. Alright, everybody. So those are collections. Think of them as a single variable used to store multiple values. There's four general purpose collections for beginners, lists, sets, tuples, and then dictionaries which we'll talk about next. Each of them has unique benefits. Lists are ordered and changeable. Duplicates are okay. A set is unordered and immutable. But adding and removing elements is okay. No duplicates allowed. A tuple is ordered and unchangeable. Duplicates are okay. And they are faster than lists. Use tuples if you can over a list. But yeah, those are a few collections in Python. Hello, everybody. Today we will be creating a shopping cart program. This program will be an exercise to follow the previous lesson on lists, sets, and tuples. The more that we practice with those collections, the better we'll be at using them. So I thought we'd create an exercise to get the hang of it before moving on. In this program, we will have two lists. Foods? These lists will be empty. We'll declare them but not use them quite yet. And prices. Then a total. Total equals zero. The reason that I'm not using tuples is that tuples are unchangeable. We're going to ask a user what food they would like to buy. We can't depend any elements to a tuple. We're not using sets because sets are unordered. I mean, I guess technically you could, but at the end of this program, I'm going to print our shopping cart in order. So I think lists would probably be the best. We have an empty list of foods and an empty list of prices. We'll use a while loop. While true. If our condition is set to true, we'll need some way to break out of the while loop. We'll need a break statement somewhere. We'll get to that later. We will ask the user what food would they like to buy. Let's declare variable food equal to input. Enter a food to buy. To exit the while loop, you need to press Q. Q to quit. Then let's check if food is equal to Q. Lowercase Q. Then we will break. We're not done with the program, but let's at least test it. It looks like it works. Now what if somebody types in uppercase Q? Pizza, hamburger, uppercase Q? Well we can't actually quit. After accepting our user input, if food dot lower method, this will take our input, make it lowercase just for a comparison. Let's try that again. Pizza, hamburger, all type capital Q to quit. And that is valid. Follow food with the lower method to temporarily make the user input lowercase. Just in case they type in capital Q. If the user doesn't want to quit, let's add an else statement. Else, let's take our foods, use the append method. Then add whatever food the user typed in. We'll also need a price. Let's ask a user for the price. Price equals input. Enter the price of, let's use an F string. A, whatever food the user types in. Pick a unit of currency. I'll pick dollars. We are working with numbers. We should type cast our input as a floating point number. Since we're working with prices. So we will accept a price. Add our food item to our list of foods. Do the same thing with prices. Prices.append. Whatever the price was. And that is the while loop. Let's test this program again to be sure that everything's working. Pizza. Pizza will be $5.99. Enter a food to buy. Hamburger. Hamburger will be $350. Hotdog. Hotdogs will be $175. I would like to quit. I will type either capital Q or lowercase Q. Both will work. And we have escaped the while loop. So the while loop is now complete. Outside of the while loop, let's display our shopping cart. Let's print some decorative text. Maybe five dashes. Your cart. Then another five dashes. I will then iterate over all of the elements found within my foods list. For every food in my list of foods. Let's print each food item. Let's take a look so far. Again, we have a pizza. The price was $5.99. Hamburger. The price was $350. Hotdog. $175. Q to quit. Okay, your cart. That will display the individual list items. If you would rather have these list items arranged horizontally in one line, you can add this keyword and equals this end keyword will replace the new line character at the end of a print statement with some other character like a space. Let's try that again. I'll try not to take too much time. Pizza. $5.99. Hamburger. $350. Hotdog. $175. Q to quit. Yeah, that's much better. We are horizontally listing all of the different items within our list. You could revert back to the vertical list if you'd prefer that. I'll keep my output like this. Then we will need to iterate and add up all the prices for every price and prices. We do have a total variable that we declared. Let's utilize that total equals total plus price. Otherwise we could shorten this to plus equals price. That would do the same thing. Then we will display the total print. I'll use an upstring. Our total is, I'll add a unit of currency. I picked the dollar sign. Whatever the total is. Okay, let's run this program one last time. Enter a food to buy. Pizza. Which was $5.99. Hamburger. Which was $350. Hotdogs. They are $175. Q to quit. Here's your shopping cart. I'm just going to add one new line real quick. Right before we display the total. Just an empty print statement. Here are the results. Your cart. Pizza, hamburger, hotdog. Your total is $11."}
