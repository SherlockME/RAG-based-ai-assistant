Alright everybody, well that is a shopping cart program. I thought this would be a fun exercise to follow the previous lesson on lists, sets, and tuples. And well, yeah that is a shopping cart program in Python. Hey what's going on everybody? So today I'm going to be explaining 2D lists. 2D meaning 2D dimensional. You do also have the capability of creating 2D tuples. I thought today we would use 2D lists just because they're pretty flexible. A 2 dimensional list is just a list made up of lists. It's really useful if you ever need a grid or matrix of data, kind of like an Excel spreadsheet. Let's create 3 lists. A list of fruit, vegetables, and meat. I'm going to speed up this video, feel free to pause if you need to catch up. Here I have 3 lists, a list of fruit, vegetables, and meat. Each of these lists is a 1 dimensional list. To create a 2 dimensional list, well you would begin by creating a 1 dimensional list. Let's create a list of groceries. All I would need to do is add my individual lists as elements to the outer list, the 2D list. We have fruits, vegetables, and meats. Normally to print a list or your other collections, you would print the name of the list. In my list fruits I have Apple Orange Banana Coconut. To access or change one of the elements, you would type the name of the list then you use the index operator, so fruits at index of 0 is a pineapple again. With a 2D list, it's a little different. If I were to print my 2D list of groceries, we would lay out the entire 2D list flat. We have individual lists separated with a comma, all enclosed within a set of square brackets. Taking the elements found within our 2D list, I'm going to line these up kind of like this. It kind of represents a grid or matrix with rows and columns. Each individual list resembles a row. Each element resembles a column. If I were to print groceries at index 0, in place of returning one element found within one of the lists, that would return an entire row. So groceries at index 0 is my fruits list. Groceries at index 1 is my vegetables list. For one of the elements found within one of the rows, you would need two indices. If I need the apple from the first row within my 2D list of groceries, that would be row 0, column 0. It's kind of like coordinates. Row 0, column 0, that would be my apple. 0, 1, which is an orange. 0, 2 is banana. 0, 3 is coconut. For the next row, I would set the first index to be 1. Row 1, column 0, that would be celery. I'm going to speedrun this row quick just to show you all the different elements. One one is carrots. One two is potatoes. If we try to access 1, 3, that index is out of range because we only have three elements within this row. So then the next row would have an index of 2. Column 0 would be chicken. Two one is fish. Two two is turkey. Two three is out of bounds. To access an element from a 2D list, you would need two indices in place of 1. As using just one would return the entire row. Like so. Now when you declare a 2D list, you don't need to necessarily give each inner list a name. We could do something like this. I'm going to replace these names with the rows. I'm just going to put these on a new line to make it more readable. That would work too. Just separate each inner list with comma, then enclose everything with the set of square brackets. If you ever need to iterate over the elements of a 2D list, you can use nested loops. If I were to use a single for loop, let's say for every, maybe collection. For every collection in groceries, let's print what our collection is. Using a single for loop would iterate over the rows. But to also iterate over the elements found within each row, we would use a nested loop. For every food in our collection. Let's print what our food is. Using nested loops, we can iterate over all of the elements found within our 2D list. But I'm going to make this more organized like that grid structure we have. I'm going to replace the new line character at the end of a print statement with a space. Then when we exit the nested loop, I will print a new line by using just an empty print statement. There, that kind of resembles our grid structure. We have rows. And we have columns. With two dimensional collections, you're not limited to just lists. You could create a list of tuples. So the inner rows will be surrounded with a set of parentheses. You know, this is also valid too. Or you can make a 2D tuple. It's a tuple that's made up of tuples. You could make a tuple made up of sets. Sets are enclosed with a set of curly braces. Here we have a tuple made of sets. Use whatever is best for your own programs. Let's go over an exercise. Let's create a two dimensional keypad that you would normally find on a phone. We have three data types. A list, a set, or a tuple. The elements in a set are unordered. So we can't use that. These numbers need to be in order. If we have the option, a tuple is faster than a list. A tuple is ordered and unchangeable. So we should use it if we can. And that's perfectly fine. Let's create a 2D tuple this time. I will name this 2D tuple numpad. We have an outer set of parentheses. Then an inner set of parentheses for each row. We will have four rows. The first row will be 1, 2, 3. The second row, I'm going to put this on a new line. 4, 5, 6. The next row will be 7, 8, 9. Then the last row will be an asterisk character, then 0, then the pound sign. So numpad in this case is a 2D tuple. Let's use a for loop to iterate over every row. This will be the outer loop for every row. For every row in numpad, let's begin by printing our row. So we're printing every row in our numpad, but I'd like to remove the parentheses. Let's create a nested loop for every, maybe num, for num in row. Print whatever that num is. We have one long vertical line. Let's replace the new line character at the end of our print statement with the space. Then when we escape the nested loop, let's print a new line. And there is our telephone number pad. You can see it's a grid made up of rows and columns. So yeah, that's a 2D list, well, a 2D collection. It's a collection that's made up of collections. Then with our numpad, we made a 2D tuple. If you ever need a grid or matrix of data, a 2D collection would work perfect. And there you have it, everybody. Those are 2D collections in Python. Hello again, everybody. So today we're going to create a quiz game in Python. Let's declare all of the different collections and variables that we'll need first. We will need a tuple of questions. A 2D tuple of options. My quiz will have 5 questions, but you can add more or less questions. Then a tuple of answers. A list of guesses. We will be appending guesses to our list. That's why we're using a list rather than a tuple. A score variable, which I will set to be 0. Then question number. This variable will keep track of what number question we're on. Alright, let's begin with our questions. I have 5. Here are my questions. They're all science related. Feel free to choose your own. This is what I have. How many elements are in the periodic table? Which animal lays the largest eggs? What is the most abundant gas in Earth's atmosphere? How many bones are in the human body? Which planet in the solar system is the hottest? These are the questions, but we'll need options. Let's add 4 options for every question. This is why we're using a 2-dimensional tuple. Each inner tuple will consist of 4 elements. They will be options A, B, C or D. Let's copy these elements. Then paste them within each tuple. This first element corresponds to my first question. How many elements are in the periodic table? I'll come up with some answers. I'll add some answers for the rest of these tuples too. We have a tuple of correct answers. The orders are C, D, A, A, B. If you come up with your own options, your answers may be different. Now that we have all of our different collections and variables taken care of, let's display each question. I will iterate over our tuple of questions. They are iterable for every question and questions. I'm going to print some decorative text. I think that's probably good. Then I will print each question we're iterating over. So let's see what we have so far. There's all five questions. After we display every question, I need to display every option for every option in options. Our options is a 2D tuple. Let's add the index operator. The index is going to be our question number variable. It's a number. So at first we're accessing options at index of zero, then one, two, three, four, five. We will print every option in options at a given row number. Let's test this. Okay, we have some options, but all of these options are for the first question. We will need to increment our question number. So let's do that. Maybe here. 1 number plus equals 1. That is much better. Before iterating the question number, we will ask the user for a guess. Guess equals input enter a b c d. In case the user types in something that's lowercase, I will follow this input with the upper method to make the user input uppercase. We will take our list of guesses, use the append method, add our guess to that list. If our guess is equal to the answers tuple at index of question number, that means the user guessed the right answer. Let's increase the user score score plus equals one. Then print the word correct. Correct. Else, we will print incorrect. I'll use an F string. Our answers at index of question number is the"}
