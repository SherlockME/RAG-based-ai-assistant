So is Sunday the weekend? That is true. Monday? That is false? Saturday? That is true. And we do have a wild card case if there are no matches. Is pizza a day of the weekend? That is false. There is a way we can modify this match case too. We tend to be repeating ourselves a lot. The day is Monday through Friday all return false. We are going to use the or logical operator which is represented with a vertical bar. If the case of Saturday or Sunday return true, if the case is Monday or Tuesday, you can get rid of that or Wednesday. Or Thursday, or Friday, then we will return false. We can keep our wild card case. So is Saturday, part of the weekend. That is true. Is Monday? False? Sunday? True? Friday? False? And pizza? We have our wild card case. That gives us false. Alright everybody, so those are match case statements. They are similar to switches and other programming languages. They are an alternative to using many L-SIF statements. We execute some code if a value matches a case. The benefits is that the code is cleaner and the syntax is more readable. And while everybody, those are match case statements in Python. Hello friends, it's me again. Today I'm going to explain modules. A module is just a Python file containing code you want to include in your program. You use the import keyword to include a module. You can use built-in modules or create your own. Sometimes it's useful to break up a large program in two reusable separate files. For a list of all the modules found within the standard Python library, you can use the help function, pass in the word modules, and then we would need to print this. Here are many of the different modules available to you. A few you may recognize would be math, string, time. One of my favorite names of a module is the pickle module. Unfortunately, it doesn't have anything to do with pickles. It's used for serialization. To list all of the different variables and functions found within a module, you can place that name of the module within the help function. For example, with the math module, here are a few different variables we would have access to, and a few different functions. To include a module, we would type import the name of the module, for example, math. I now have accessed everything found within the math module, including those variables and functions. To access those variables and functions, I would normally type the name of the module, dot the name of the variable or function, such as pi. Then let's print this. Pi from the math module is 3.14 and some change. Another way to import is to type import the name of the module, as you can give your module a nickname and alias. Whatever you think of, such as m, m short for math, we would no longer refer to this module as math. We would refer to it as our alias. Using an alias would reduce some of the typing you have to use if you have a very long module name. Another way to import is to use from the name of the module, import something specific. Pi, for instance, you would no longer need the module name. From math, import pi, pi would be included within our namespace. However, I tend to not use from import as much, just because it's possible there could be name conflicts. Here's an example. Let's say from math, import e, e is an exponential constant. e is 2.71. What if I was to create a program where we have four variables named a, b, c, d, a equals 1, b equals 2, c equals 3, d equals 4. Then I'm going to print e from the math module to the power of a. That would give me 2.71. Then let's do this with b, c, and d. e to the power of b, e to the power of c, e to the power of d. Here are the results. Let's say we have a different variable, e. e will be 5. Then I will print e to the power of e. We have imported e from the math module. When we have declared all of these variables, technically what we've done is we have created another version of e. We will end up using the second version, rather than the version that we have imported from the math module. All my results are now different, and it's possible you may not realize it. I like to be more explicit. I'm going to import math if I'm using a variable or function from a module. I much prefer to prefix that variable name or function with the name of the module in which it's from. math.e to the power of a, to the power of b, to the power of c, to the power of d, math.e to the power of our variable e. And these results are to be expected. Now to create a module, what we're going to do is right-click on our project folder, go to new, python file, think of a module name, maybe example, then click python file, we now have two tabs, main and example, declare whatever you would like within this module. Let's create our own variable pi. pi equals 3.14159. Then a few functions. Let's create a function to square and argument that's passed in. Define square, we will accept an argument which we will name x, then return x to the power of 2. Let's define a cube function. We will accept one argument, then return x to the power of 3. Maybe a circumference function. Define circumference, we will accept a radius, then return 2 times pi times radius, then an area function to calculate the area of a circle. We will accept a radius as an argument, then return pi times radius to the power of 2. All right, here is our example module. Within our main python program, let's import the name of our module, which we named example. We now have access to everything within this module. I'm going to declare a variable result and set it to the name of my module, dot pi, then I will print the result, which is 3.14159. Let's utilize the square function. Result equals example dot square, let's square 3, which is 9. Let's use the cube function. That would be 27 circumference. That would give me 18.8, then area, that would be 28.2. That's how to create your own module. It can be useful at times to separate your program into individual files. All right, everybody, in conclusion, a module is just a file containing code. You want to include in your program. You use import to include a module. You can use built-in modules or create your own. If you do need a list of the modules available to you, again, you can use the help function, then pass in the word modules. And while everybody, that's how to get started with modules in Python. Hey friends, it's me again. Today, I'm going to explain both variable scope and scope resolution. Variable scope is where a variable is both visible and accessible. With scope resolution, when we're using a variable, there is a certain order known as the ledgb rule in which we locate that variable. Local enclosed, global, built-in. We'll get to this momentarily. Let's begin with variable scope. I have two functions, function one, function two. Within function one, a equals one, then we print a, within function two, b equals two, then we print b. If I were to invoke these functions, let's invoke function one, then function two. We would print one, then two. Variables declared within a function have a local scope. Variable a is local to function one, variable b is local to function two. Within function one, if I were to print b, and function two, if I were to print a, we would run into a name error. Name b is not defined, and the same thing would apply with a. Functions can't see inside of other functions. Imagine that we're function one. This is our house. We can see everything that's going on inside of our house, but function two is our neighbor's house. We can't see what's going on inside of our neighbor's house. We have no idea what b is. With function two, function two has no idea what a is. That's where variable scope comes in. It's where a variable is visible and accessible. Functions can't see inside of other functions, but they can see inside of their own function. That's why we sometimes pass arguments two functions, so that our functions are aware of them. Using this concept, we could create different versions of the same variable. Let's rename a to be x, and b to be x as well. Then I will print x. We have two different versions of x. A local version of x found within function one, and a local version of x found within function two. Whenever we utilize a variable, we will first look to see if there's any local instance of that variable. If there isn't, we would move to the enclosed scope. With an enclosed scope, one example is when you have a function declared within another function. I'm going to place function two within function one. This is allowed in Python. This is a more advanced concept. We'll cover this more in the future. So I'm going to eliminate this print statement. Let's get rid of function two. At the end of function one, we will invoke function two. Like I said, it's pretty complex. We won't be using this until much later. Within function two, if I was to print x, we would use the local version, or x equals two. If I was to eliminate this variable declaration, we would use the enclosed version instead, where x equals one. There's an order of operations. Use any local variables first, then enclosed variables. We're printing x within function two. Since x wasn't found within the local scope, we would use x within the enclosed scope. But like I said, that's a more advanced topic. You should at least be aware of it. Let's move on to the global scope, global meaning outside of any functions. I will eliminate these variable declarations. Within function one, we're printing x, and within function two, we're also printing x. I will declare a global version of x, where x equals three. x is outside of any functions. When I run this program, we're printing three twice, once for function one, and once for function two. There's no longer a local version of x for both of these functions. If there were, we would end up using these local versions instead. Function one, prints one, function two, prints two. If there's no local version, as well as no enclosed version, we would move on to the global version, where x equals three. Last in our order is built in. I think what we'll do, though, is from math, import e. e is an exponential constant. I'm going to print what e is. e is 2.71. e is built in. I will create a function to print e. Define function one. All I'm doing is printing e. Then we should invoke it. Invoke function one. If I was to set e to be a different value, like three, what we're doing technically is creating two different versions of e. Variables can share the same name as long as they're within a different scope. We have a built-in version of e and a global version of e. If I was to print e now, it would print my global version. Because using the ledgb order, we would first look for any local version of e, then enclosed version, then global, which we do have one of, then lastly built in. All right, everybody. So in conclusion, variable scope is just where a variable is both visible and accessible. Python has a scope resolution order, ledgb. If we're using a variable, we will first look in the local scope for that variable. If we don't find that variable in the local scope, we will move over to an enclosed scope, then global, then built in. We will have more practice with this in the future. And while everybody, that is both variable scope and scope resolution in Python. Hey, everybody. So today I got to talk about this if statement. If dundername is equal to a string of dundermain, when you see this if statement, it's usually followed by a call to a function named main, or something similar. A majority of the driving code behind a program is usually found within some sort of main method. When you see this if statement, basically speaking it means that this script can be imported, or it can run standalone. Functions in classes in this module can be reused in other programs without the main block of code running. Sometimes you would like the functionality of a program without executing the main body of code. A good example could be a library in a"}
