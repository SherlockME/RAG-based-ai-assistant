x's maybe we're hiding somebody's credit card number except the last four digits Okay, then variable last digits Alright, and here's our credit card number where only the last four digits are visible Hey, you know what let's add one more exercise Let's reverse the characters in the string. I'm going to reassign credit number Equals credit number If we need the entire string we don't necessarily need a starting index or an ending index But for the step this will be negative Negative one will reverse a string then let's print whatever our new credit card number is print credit number and Yeah, there is our credit number backwards To reverse a string you set the step to be negative one So yeah everybody that is string indexing in Python we can access elements of a sequence using the indexing operator Which is a set of straight brackets? You can list a starting position ending position and even a step if you need to skip over characters But yeah, that is string indexing in Python Hey everybody in this topic I'm gonna explain format specifiers Format specifiers when used in the context of an f string They allow us to format a value based on what flags are inserted Following your value you would type a colon and then some flags Depending on what flags you insert it will format your output a certain way you could add decimal point precision Allocate space Zero pad values left justify right justify a central line all sorts of things Let's have some practice. I'll create three prices price one price two price three Price one will be three point one four one five nine These values aren't in dollars and cents yet, but they will be Price two will be negative nine eight seven dot six five as you can see I'm just making up numbers here price three is 12.34 Let's display our prices using some f strings Price one is Placeholder price one Then we will do this for price two and price three Price two is price two price three is price three Within our placeholder following the value we can add a colon Then some flags those flags are the formats specifiers They will format our value a particular way depending on what we insert after the colon To add a decimal point precision you would type after the colon dot Then the amount of decimals to be displayed maybe two then f meaning floating point number Let's do that with price two and price three colon dot two f Price one is now three point one four price two is Negative nine hundred eighty seven dot six five price three is twelve point three four I think I'm gonna add some dollar signs before the placeholder Yeah, that's much better For less precision maybe one decimal place you can change the two to a one So point one f Each number only displays one decimal point one point six point three Whereas in point three F would display three decimal places point one four two point six five zero point three four zero Even though price two and price three only have two decimal places in the original numbers We will concatenate some additional zeros To allocate space to display a value after the colon add some number some number for that many spaces. How about ten? Each value now has a total of ten spaces to display the output one two three four five six seven eight nine ten If you were to pre-seat a number with zero while these numbers would be zero padded Each number is now zero padded to let justify a value you would use a left-angle bracket All these numbers are now left justified then we have all of the space after They're all uniform right justify would be a right-angle bracket And I believe that's the default Central line I believe is the carrot symbol Yep, our numbers are now centered if you have any positive values and you would like to display a plus sign just use plus Any positive number is preceded with the plus sign any negative number is preceded with the negative sign or You could use a space for any positive numbers. So colon space These numbers are lined up evenly even though we have a negative number in here. There is a thousand separator, which is a comma We should probably increase the value of our prices 3,000 negative 9,870 1,200 Each thousands place is now separated with a comma we could also mix and match flags I would like a thousand separator along with decimal point precision of two decimal places And why not I will precede each number with a plus sign of its positive Yep, here we are So based on what you're looking for you can add some combination of flags So yeah, those are format specifiers everybody within your placeholder Insert your value a colon then certain flags based on what you're looking for exactly But yeah, those are just a few format specifiers in Python Hey everybody in this topic. I'm gonna explain why loops a while loop will execute some code While some condition remains true. Here's an example. We'll use an if statement first We will ask a user for their name name equals input Enter your name If our name is equal to an empty string that means the user didn't type in anything Let's print a message You did not enter your name else We will print Using an f string. Hello Our users name If I were to skip this prompt We would execute this if statement then we continue with the rest of the program What if I would like to continually prompt the user to type in their name? We can't continue until they type in something Well, we could replace this if statement with a while loop While this condition is true continue to execute this code within the while loop I'm going to reprompt the user to type in a name Then if we were to exit the while loop then we will print hello whatever your name is So let's run this Enter your name. I'm going to hit enter you did not enter your name and to your name no no no Okay, I give up. I'll type in my first name hit enter. Hello. Whatever your first name is While this condition remains true Execute this code Potentially forever until this condition is no longer true So that's one of the main benefits of a while loop if it's not true Then you exit out of the while loop and that's why we were able to continue then print our name hello name You do want some way to escape out of the while loop. Otherwise you'll run into what's known as an infinite loop So let's say while name is equal to an empty string We will print you did not enter your name So I'm going to hit enter so we are stuck in an infinite loop We can't actually escape this loop. We didn't give ourselves an exit strategy That's why previously we reprompted the user to type in something we're giving them a chance to escape In a way it kind of works like an if statement, but instead of executing some code once it's potentially infinite Here's another example this time. Let's ask for a user's age Age equals and I will convert the input to an integer Enter your age We'll need the user to type in a positive number While age is less than zero Let's print a message to let the user know that they can't do that Age Can't be negative Then we need some strategy to escape Let's reprompt the user to enter in their age Once they type in something that's valid we can escape out of the while loop So let's print using an f string you are Age Years old So into your age I'm going to say negative one age can't be negative negative two Negative one million Okay, I give up how about 21 you are 21 years old. So that was another example While our age variable is less than zero repeat this code forever Let's go over example three I'm going to introduce some logical operators We will have the user type in a food they like Food equals input Enter a food you like But in order to escape they need to press Q to quit While food is equal to the letter Q Continue this while loop However, I'm going to make one change We want to exit the while loop when they press Q So you could say while not food equals Q So within this while loop let's print the food that they stated that they like I'll use an f string You like Your variable food Then we will prompt the user to enter in another food that they like Enter another food you like Q to quit Then once we escape the while loop we will print just by Enter a food you like Q to quit I like pizza You like pizza I like sushi You like sushi I like ramen You like ramen Okay, this program is kind of lame so I'm going to press Q to quit And we escape the while loop we have printed by So you could do something while something is not true by using the not logical operator All right last example example for We will use the or logical operator We'll ask a user to type in a number between 1 and 10 Let's say num equals input Enter a number between 1 through 10 Then I will typecast the input as an integer While our number is less than 1 or our number is greater than 10 Let's reprompt the user Let's print using an f string Our variable num is not valid Then we will reprompt the user Enter a number between 1 and 10 Once we escape the while loop then we will print our number Using an f string your number is our variable num Enter a number between 1 through 10 0 0 is not valid Negative 1 100 Nope 5 Your number is 5 That's an example of how you can add a logical operators to wild loops While this condition is true Or this condition is true Execute this code forever All right everybody so those are wild loops A wild loop will execute some code While some condition remains true It's fairly useful for verifying user input If a user types in some input that is not valid you can reprompt them And there's many other uses that we'll discuss in the future But yeah those are wild loops in python Why hello everybody In today's video we'll be creating a compound interest calculator in python For those that don't know Interest is a charge for the privilege of borrowing money to some individual or organization When you place money in a bank account you typically accrue interest We'll create a program to tell you what your new balance will be After accruing interest for so many years But the user is going to decide the initial principle That's the investment The rate of interest and the time in years That this balance has been accruing interest So let's begin Let's declare three variables A principle A rate that is rate of interest And time time will be in years We've recently learned about wild loops I would like to include those within this program Just so we get the hang of using them We will ask the user to type in an initial principle investment We will continue to prompt the user to type in a principle that's above zero Our condition will be while principle is less than or equal to zero We will take our principle Assign it some user input Enter the principle amount Then we would like to type cast our input"}
