I'll get rid of the app. Invalid email. I'll get rid of the period following Gmail. That email is also invalid. In this example, we're checking two conditions. If this value is found within this sequence and this value is found within this sequence. Alright everybody, so those are membership operators in and not in. They will return a Boolean based on whether a value or a variable is found within a sequence, which include but are not limited to strings, lists, tapples, sets, or dictionaries. And while everybody, those are membership operators in Python. Hey, what's going on everybody? So in today's video, I got to explain list comprehensions in Python. A list comprehension is a concise way to create lists in Python. They're compact and easier to read than traditional loops. Basically, you have to follow this formula for every value in something that's iterable, meaning you can loop through it, check some condition, then do this expression. So let me give you an example with using a traditional loop. Then you'll be able to see why a list comprehension is useful. We're going to create a list and double the numbers one through ten. Doubles equals an empty list. Using a traditional for loop, we will say for every value, let's say x in range one through eleven. Remember that in the range function, the second number is exclusive. This will give you the numbers one through ten. For the first iteration, x is going to be one, then two, three, all the way up until ten. So we'll iterate ten times. During each iteration, I'm going to take my list of doubles, use the built-in append method, we will append x during each iteration. That's going to be the value times two. So if I were to print my list of doubles, here's the result. We have the numbers one through ten all doubled, two, four, six, eight, ten, twelve, fourteen, sixteen, eighteen, twenty. So this is a lot to write. We can use a list comprehension to make this code more compact and easier to read. Here's how. We need a name for this list, let's say doubles equals an empty list. Within our list, we'll follow this formula. We have an expression for value in iterable and optionally, we can check a condition. We'll do this in exercises later on in this topic. We'll begin with for every value, let's say x. In our iterable, our iterable is going to be a range one through ten. Again, for the first iteration, x will be one, then the second iteration, x will be two, all the way up until ten. During each iteration, what would we like to do with x, our value? Let's take x, multiply it by two, and return it. Then, if I was to print my list of doubles, we have the numbers two, four, six, eight, ten, twelve, fourteen, sixteen, eighteen, twenty. For every value in this iterable, do this, multiply it by two. This is a list comprehension. It's a concise way to create list and Python. We'll go over a few exercises. So this time, we will triple each number. We'll create a list of triples equals let's say this time for every y in range one through ten. So we have to write eleven, take y and multiply it by three. Then we will print our list of triples, three, six, nine, twelve, fifteen, eighteen, so on and so forth. Let's square each number. We'll create a list of squares for every z in range one through ten. To square a number, we take that number, multiply it by itself. So the numbers one through ten squared is one four nine sixteen fifteen thirty six forty nine sixty four eighty one one hundred. So ten times ten is one hundred. Now we're going to work with strings. We'll create a list of fruits equals think of some fruit. These are all going to be strings apple orange banana coconut. I'm going to take each string in this list and make it uppercase. We could assign this to a new list such as uppercase fruits or we can simply just reassign it just to keep it simple. I'll reassign it. So again, we're following this formula. I like to begin with the four value in iterable portion. For every fruit in our iterable of fruits, what do we want to do? Well, let's take each fruit, take each fruit, use the built-in upper method to make it uppercase. Then I'm going to print my list of fruits. Each string in this list is now all uppercase. You could even cut down on one of the steps with our iterable of fruits. I will place this list. And this does work too. Although I do find this a little more difficult to read, but you can take either option. How about instead of making each string uppercase? We'll take the first letter of each string, then put it with a new list. So let's take each fruit at index of zero. That will give us the first letter. We'll place it within a new list of fruit, char's meaning characters. Here's the result. A, O, B, C. For every fruit in our list of fruits, return the first character of each string. A, O, B, C. Now we'll work with conditions. We'll create a list of numbers, both negative and positive. Numbers equals, let's say, one, negative two, three, negative four, five, negative six. We'll create a list comprehension to create a new list where all of the numbers are positive. Our new list will be positive numbs. Equals will write a list comprehension for every, let's say, num in numbers. We'll write a condition. Return this number if our num is greater than or equal to zero. We do need an expression. If we're not modifying each value, we can just return the value of num. During this exercise, we're more focused on the if condition, rather than the expression. If our value of num meets this condition, simply return it and place it within this new list. Let's print our list of positive numbers. And we have one, three, five. Let's do this with negative numbers. I'll just copy what we have and change a few things around. This list will be negative numbers, negative num's. For every num in numbers, check this condition. Check to see if num is less than zero. If so, return that number. Let's print our list of negative numbers, negative two, negative four, negative six. Let's check to see if there's any even numbers. Even num's equals for every num in numbers. Check to see if our num is divisible by two. And we can do that with the modulus operator followed by two. The modulus operator will give you the remainder of any division. If our number is even, number modulus two will equal zero. If it's even, this is going to equal zero. If it's odd, it's going to be one. We're not modifying our value. We're just going to return our number. Our list of even numbers should be negative two, negative four, negative six. Let me add one more value. Let's add positive eight. Negative two, negative four, negative six, positive eight. Maybe we'll add one more. Negative seven. Okay, let's find any odd numbers. Let's copy this line of code. Replace even numbers with odd numbers. If num modulus two is equal to one, that means that number doesn't divide by two evenly. Then we'll print our odd numbers. One, three, five, negative seven. All these numbers are odd. Here's the last exercise. We'll create a list of grades. We'll create a new list of any grades that are considered passing, meaning they scored 60 or above. So let's say one student has a grade of 85, another with the 42, 79, 90, 56, 61. Let's say 30. I will create a new list of passing grades. Equals, again follow this formula. For every grade in grades, check our condition. If our grade is greater than or equal to 60, we will return the current grade. Then let's print our list of passing grades. That will give us 85, 79, 90, and 61. All of these grades are greater than or equal to 60. All right, everybody. So that is a list comprehension. It's a concise way to create lists in Python. They're compact and easier to read than traditional loops. Remember for every value in your iterable, optionally, you can check in condition. You can write an expression to modify that value if you choose and return something. All right, everybody. So those are list comprehensions in Python. Hey, everybody. So today, I'm going to explain match case statements in Python. If you're familiar with other programming languages, this is also known as a switch. Match case statements are alternatives to using many L-SIF statements. We execute some code if a value matches a case. The benefits of using a match case statement is that they're cleaner and the syntax is more readable. In this sample program, I have a function. There is one parameter, a day. Day will be a number, ideally a number one through seven. Depending on this number, we'll return a string corresponding to the day of the week. If day equals one, then it is Sunday. Two, it is Monday, all the way up to seven, where it will be Saturday. I do have an else clause if we pass in something that's not valid, like pizza. Pizza is not a day, but it really should be. Not a valid day. A cleaner and more readable alternative is to use a match case statement instead of many L-SIF statements. Here's how. I'm going to take my if and many L-SIF statements and enclose them within a match case. Match case. The case is going to be the value we're examining. The case will be day. Colin. We're going to examine our value of day against matching cases. We're going to replace if day equals with the following just simply case. So let's do that with each of these statements. If you have an else clause, you're instead going to have a case of underscore. An underscore in a match case statement is a wild card. We will perform this case if there are no matching cases. This case would function as the else statement. Here's what we're working with now. If I pass in one and return the day of the week, we would get Sunday. Two, would be Monday. Three, Tuesday. Seven, Is Saturday. And then let's try that day of pizza. That is not a valid day. A match case statement is an alternative to using many L-SIF statements. I find this much easier to read than the many L-SIF statements. Both would technically function. Let's go over a second example. We will create a function of is weekend. We have to pass in a day. This time our day is going to be a string such as Monday. The value for each case instead of a number is going to be a string. If our day matches a case of Sunday, let's return how about a Boolean of true. We're checking to see if it's the weekend. If our day is equal to a case of Monday, then we will return false. Let's do this with the other days. I'm going to fast forward the video. We will call the function of is weekend."}
