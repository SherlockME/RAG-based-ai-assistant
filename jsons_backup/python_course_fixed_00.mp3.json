I've also included 20 different hands-on projects to help you learn. You can find the entire list in the description of this video. Our final project will be a weather app that fetches real-time weather data from an API. Even if you've never coded anything in your life before, I'll walk you through the basics, the ABCs of programming. If that sounds good to you, then I encourage you to sit back, relax, and enjoy the show. This course doesn't cost you anything, but if you would like to help me out, you can help increase its reach by hitting the like button, leave a random comment down below, and subscribe if you'd like to be a fellow bro. Thank you, I appreciate it. I don't like boring introductions, so I say we just jump right in. There's two things we'll need to download. The first is a Python interpreter to convert our written code to machine code. We're going to head to python.org, go to downloads, and download the latest version. We will open this executable. If you're on Windows, you'll want to check this checkbox, add Python EXE to path, and we will install now. The setup was successful, and that's all you need to do to download the Python interpreter. The second download we'll need is an IDE, an integrated development environment, basically a place where we can write code. For IDE's, there's two popular choices when writing Python code, PyCharm, and VS code. If you already use VS code, you can stick with that. Just be sure to download the Python extension. I find PyCharm more beginner friendly, if you've never coded before. If you would like to use PyCharm, go to JetBrains.com, slash PyCharm, and we will click this green download button. There's two versions of PyCharm, the professional version, and the community version. The professional version is paid for, I would not recommend using it, only because there's plenty of free IDE's on the market. We'll use the community edition, the free one, because I don't like to pay for things, and I'm sure you don't either. Select the correct download for your operating system, I'm running Windows, I will download PyCharm. We will open this executable, click Next, you could select a destination folder, I'll keep it as is. Next, I'll create a desktop shortcut, but you don't necessarily need to, click Next, install, and we'll just have to give it a moment. Okay, the setup is now complete. I'll check this checkbox to run PyCharm when we close this window. After opening PyCharm, we're going to create a new project. You can rename your Python project, I'll keep it as is. You can select a location, again, I won't change that. You can create a sample welcome script, but for this tutorial, we won't. Let's select the latest Python version, and create our new project. In the menu to the left, we're going to create a new Python file, file, new, Python file. Let's name this file main, but really you can name it anything, and select Python file. Python files end with the py file extension. We should have our main Python file within our Python project folder. Now we're going to print something to the console window. Within our main Python file, we're going to write a print statement, so type print, add a set of parentheses. Between the set of parentheses, we will add a set of double quotes to print something, or single quotes, either one. My own preference is double quotes. Normally in a programming tutorial, the instructor would tell you to print something such as Hello World, but we like to be different here. Instead, think of your favorite food. In this case, I like pizza. I will print. I like pizza. To run our Python program, we will click the screen arrow to run our main Python file. We should have a console window that displays our output. I like pizza, or whatever your favorite food is. Let's print another line of code. Let's print. It's really good. By adding a second print statement, we are printing a second line of code. Now we'll discuss comments. The Python interpreter doesn't output comments. To write a comment, you use a pound sign. I like to call this a hashtag. My comment will be this is my first Python program. Comments are used as notes for yourself or for other people reading this code. If I were to run this code again, this comment is not displayed to the output. We still have I like pizza. It's really good. All right, everybody. So that is your very first Python program. And in the next topic, we'll discuss variables. All right, everybody. We are moving on to variables. A variable is a container for a value. There's four different data types we'll discuss. Strings, integers, floats, and Booleans. Yes, I know. That's a silly name. A variable behaves as if it was the value it contains. Each variable should have a unique name. Let's say we have a variable of first name. To assign a variable, you use the assignment operator of equals. For text, a string is a series of text. This can be double quotes or single quotes. My own preference is double quotes. Why don't you type in your first name? This variable, a first name, will behave as if it was this value, the series of characters. So to demonstrate this, I'm going to print my first name variable. So I'll place it within a print statement without quotes. That will print your first name. Now you don't want this within quotes. Because then you're literally printing the word first name. You could use your variable along with some text by using what is called an F string. That's the easiest way to display a variable. So you type F, then ascetic quotes. The F means format. So let's say the word hello, then we will add our variable. We will insert our variable into this text when using an F string. To do that, you need to set a curly braces. Then insert your variable. So the result is hello. What of your first name is? In my case, bro, let's create another variable. Let's say we have a variable of food, food equals think of your favorite food. For me, I will type pizza. Let's print the following. You like add a placeholder. Again, I'm using an F string. Our variable of food. Hello, bro, you like pizza. Let's create an email. Use your own email or make up one. Let's say my email is bro123atfake.com. Then let's print our email. Your email is at a placeholder. Display our email variable. Your email is bro123atfake.com. So these are strings. I'm going to add a comment that these are strings. A string is a series of characters. They can include numbers, but we treat them as characters. Now we have integers. An integer is a whole number. An example of this could be somebody's age. How old are they? According to my YouTube statistics, many of you are between the ages of 18 through 24. Let's say that I'm 25. Let me zoom in a little. Your integer should not be within quotes because it would be a string then, technically. If I would like to work with this variable, again, I'll use an F string. Let's say you are add a placeholder. Display our age variable. Years old. You are 25 years old. Another example of an integer could be a quantity. You are buying a certain amount of something. Maybe I am buying three items. I wouldn't have half an item. This would be a float, technically, rather than an integer. We are buying three of something. So let's print the following. You are buying a placeholder. Display our quantity. Items. You are 25 years old. You are buying three items. Another example of an integer could be an amount of people. Let's say, numb of students, like a classroom. There are 30 students in our class. Then we will print your class. Hours at a placeholder. Students. We will display the number of students. Numb of students. Your class has 30 students. Those are integers. They are whole numbers. And again, make sure they are not within quotes because then, technically, they would be a string. Integers, we can use an arithmetic expressions. If they were strings, we couldn't. Then we have floats. Float means floating point number. A float is a number, but it contains a decimal portion. An example would be a price. What is the price of something? 1099. Let's print our price. Print all you is an F string. The price is at a placeholder. Display our price. The price is 1099. Let's precede our placeholder with a unit of currency. I'll pick American dollars, but feel free to pick something else. The price is 10 dollars and 99 cents. So floats contain a decimal portion. What about a grade point average? GPA. Let's say my GPA is 3.2. Then I will print your GPA is Display our GPA. Your GPA is 3.2. What about a distance? A distance can contain a decimal portion. 5.5 kilometers maybe. Then I will print. You ran at a placeholder, display our distance. Then I'll add KM4 kilometers. Or you could add MI for miles, but I'll stick with kilometers. You ran 5.5 kilometers. Okay, then we have Booleans. A Boolean is either true or false. Let's say we're a student is student equals if we are a student we could say that this is true. True starts with a capital T. If we weren't a student let's say we graduate. We could say that this is false. Again the first letter is capital. Booleans only have two options true or false. So let's say that I am a student. Then I will print. Are you a student? Then we will display our Boolean value of is student. Are you a student? That is true. With Boolean values we really don't output them directly. You're more likely to see them used internally within a program such as when working with if statements. This is a topic we'll discuss in the future. So don't worry. You may see if is student if this variable is true then we will print the following. Now we don't need to use enough string. We're not going to insert any variables. You are a student. If this were false we can add an else clause where we will print. You are not a student. Our variable of is student is true. We will print the if statement. You are a student. If this were false we will print whatever is within else. You are not a student. Let's think of a few more examples. Is something for sale like a car or a product of some sort. Let's say that is true. I'll write another if statement. If for sale. If this variable contains true we will do the following. Let's print that item is for sale. Else if it's false we will print something else. That item is not available. For sale is set to true. This variable is true. We will print that item is for sale. Else if it were false we print that item is not available. One more example. Let's say we have a Boolean variable of is online. If somebody online I will set that to true. If is online if that's true we will print."}
